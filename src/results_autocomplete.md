#results from both seaarch; the brute force search and the trie search
using the timeit module to benchmark the two data structures to know the fastest
using brute force : 0.8055922000203282 seconds
using trie : 0.00016207250021398067 seconds
there ratio of brute force to trie is 4972. 
Meaning trie saves time by 4972 time better than the regular linear search
